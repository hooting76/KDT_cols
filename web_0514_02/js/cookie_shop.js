Made with brown sugar, molasses, and an incredible mix of spices including cinnamon, ginger and cloves. These cookies are chewy, dense and old-fashionably good.",

A chewy chocolate cookie stuffed with big chunks of peanut butter cups, swirled with more peanut butter and a whole peanut butter cup sunk right in the middle. Heaven!",

However, we didn't want to add it to the line up until it was perfect (and until bulk macadamias came down in price!). In every bite you will enjoy the contrast of crunchy, salty macadamia nuts and smooth, creamy white chocolate chips. Cookie paradise!",
